NAME
    RDF::TriN3 - notation 3 extensions for RDF::Trine

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends RDF::Trine in three ways:

    *   Adds a Notation 3 parser.

    *   Adds a Notation 3 serializer.

    *   Provides a subclass of literals to represent Notation 3 formulae.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Implementing N3 logic and the cwm built-ins is considered outside the
    scope of this module, though I am interested in doing that as part of a
    separate project.

    RDF::TriN3 currently relies entirely on RDF::Trine to provide
    implementations of the concept of graphs, and storage. Thus any graphs
    that can't be represented using RDF::Trine can't be represented in
    RDF::TriN3. RDF::Trine's graph model is a superset of RDF, but a subset
    of Notation 3's model. While this allows literal subjects, and literal
    and blank node predicates, these may not be supported by all storage
    engines; additionally top-level variables (?foo), and top-level @forSome
    and @forAll (i.e. not nested inside a formula) might cause problems.

    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
